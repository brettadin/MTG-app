UI Inspiration: "Stitch" HTML Exports

Location in repo:
- `doc/references/ui from stitch/`

Files included (examples generated by Stitch from Google):
- `stitch_card_search_browser_home/code.html`
- `stitch_card_search_browser_home(1)/code.html`
- `stitch_card_search_browser_home(2)/code.html`
- `stitch_card_search_browser_home(3)/code.html`
- `stitch_card_search_browser_home(4)/code.html`
- `stitch_card_search_browser_home(5)/code.html`

What these are:
- HTML/CSS mockups produced by Stitch (Google) as visual inspiration for the app UI.
- They are not direct app code; they are static HTML pages that show layout, spacing, color palettes, and examples of components (search, deck builder, import/export, favorites, analytics).

How to use them in the project:
- Design reference: Use these files for visual guidance and to create wireframes or Qt layouts.
- Extract assets: If you want specific icons or images, open the HTML and save the referenced images locally (observe copyright/attribution rules for any third-party assets).
- Implementation plan:
  - Convert visual layouts from HTML/CSS into PySide6 widgets (use `QHBoxLayout` / `QVBoxLayout`, `QSplitter` for sidebars, and `QTabWidget` for tabs).
  - Reuse the documented component API in `doc/UI_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` (e.g., `CardSearchBar`, `CardGrid`, `CardDetailsPanel`) and implement the visual styles using the app's existing theme system (`assets/themes/*.qss`).

Notes & legal:
- These are visual inspirations only. Do not copy third-party code or licensed assets from the pages.
- Keep this folder as a design reference and update `doc/references/reference_links.md` and `doc/UI_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` so future contributors know where the inspiration files are.

Suggested next steps:
1. Add a short entry to `doc/references/reference_links.md` pointing to this README (done by the agent).
2. When the user provides final deck viewer designs, update `doc/UI_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` to reference the specific Stitch files used for each screen.
3. Optionally convert the HTML to PNG wireframes and add them to `doc/references/ui from stitch/screenshots/` for quick viewing.
