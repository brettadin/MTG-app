Lands don’t require mana to play and are the main resource for casting spells.",
      "example": "Forest – Basic Land that can tap for green mana. You lay it onto the battlefield and then tap it when you need {G}. Nonbasic lands: e.g., Command Tower (Land that taps for one mana of any color in your commander’s color identity). Lands stay on the battlefield and don’t go to the graveyard unless an effect or rule (like having multiple legendary lands with the same name) causes it.",
      "suggestedEffect": "When you play a land, a terrain-themed animation plays (for a Forest, maybe trees grow or leaves rustle with a gentle green glow). Tapping a land for mana briefly highlights it and displays the mana symbol with a subtle sound (e.g., a rustling for Forest, flame whoosh for Mountain, wave sound for Island, etc.)."

    {
      "name": "Tribal",
      "description": "Tribal is a card type that only exists alongside another type (e.g., Tribal Enchantment – Shaman). It allows noncreature cards to have creature types for synergy. A Tribal card isn’t a creature itself, but carries creature subtype(s).",
      "example": "Nameless Inversion – Tribal Instant — Shapeshifter (has Changeling, making it every creature type despite being an instant). Its tribal status means it can be fetched or affected by cards that care about Shapeshifters or creature types, even though it’s not a creature spell.",
      "suggestedEffect": "No unique animation beyond its main card type (instant, sorcery, etc.), but perhaps an icon or subtle effect indicating its tribal connection (e.g., a faint image of the creature type it’s associated with) since it represents a spell with a creaturely essence."
    },
    {
      "name": "Token",
      "description": "Tokens are markers that represent permanents (usually creatures) created by effects, not regular cards. They exist on the battlefield like normal creatures or permanents, but if a token leaves the battlefield to any other zone (hand, library, etc.), it ceases to exist:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}.",
      "example": "Raise the Alarm – Instant that says \"Create two 1/1 white Soldier creature tokens.\" When cast, it puts two Soldier tokens onto your battlefield. These tokens act like normal creature permanents (they can attack, block, be destroyed), but you don’t have them in your deck; they are created by the spell.",
      "suggestedEffect": "When tokens are created, an apparition or conjuring animation plays (such as spectral soldiers materializing for Raise the Alarm). The tokens appear as card-like representations on the battlefield (often with generic art or a provided token image) with an accompanying sound (a trumpet fanfare for soldiers, a buzzing for insect tokens, etc.). When they die or are removed, they vanish in a puff of smoke or magical particles."

  ],
  "Zones": [
    {
      "name": "Library",
      "description": "The library is a player’s deck of cards. It’s kept face-down; players draw from it. At game start, each player shuffles their library and draws a starting hand from it. Whenever you draw a card, it comes from the top of your library:contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45}. If you need to draw from an empty library, you lose the game by rule.",
      "example": "If an effect says “Search your library for a Forest card,” you look through your deck to find a Forest, then shuffle. Each turn, during your draw step, you take the top card of your library into your hand. The library is essentially your draw pile. Certain cards like \"Mystical Tutor\" let you put specific cards on top of your library (so your next draw is set up).",
      "suggestedEffect": "Visually represented by a stack of cards or a deck icon. Drawing a card causes the top card to glow and fly into your hand with a card flip sound. Searching the library might show the deck riffling or a brief spread of cards. When the library is empty or dangerously low, perhaps an empty-deck animation (like a puff of dust or a warning icon) appears as a caution."
    },
    {
      "name": "Hand",
      "description": "A player’s hand consists of cards that have been drawn but not yet played. It is one of the game’s hidden zones (only the owner can see their hand):contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}. Players cast spells or play lands from their hand. By default, at the end of your turn, if you have more than 7 cards, you discard down to 7 (maximum hand size).",
      "example": "You draw cards into your hand at the start of your turn and via other effects. For instance, you have four cards in hand; you cast one (moving it from hand to stack/battlefield), leaving three. If a card like \"Brainstorm\" lets you draw 3 then put 2 from hand back on top of your library, you’d briefly have more cards in hand and then put some back. Cards like \"Thoughtseize\" can force an opponent to reveal their hand and discard a chosen card, temporarily exposing the hidden zone.",
      "suggestedEffect": "Your hand is usually shown as a fan of card backs (or small thumbnails) at the bottom of the screen. Drawing a card animates a card moving from the library to the hand fan with a flutter sound. Playing a card causes it to leave the hand area towards the battlefield or stack with a whoosh. If you have to discard, the card will slide from your hand to the graveyard pile with a subtle discard sound. The hand zone might gently glow when you have playable cards or when an effect like \"draw\" or \"discard\" is waiting."
    },
    {
      "name": "Battlefield",
      "description": "The battlefield is the in-play zone where permanents (creatures, artifacts, enchantments, lands, planeswalkers) reside and interact. It is shared by all players, essentially the “table”. At the start of the game, the battlefield is empty:contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}. Cards you cast that are permanents enter the battlefield and remain until destroyed, exiled, etc. Combat occurs on the battlefield with creatures attacking and blocking.",
      "example": "After a few turns, you might have several lands and creatures on your battlefield, and your opponent has theirs. For example, you have 3 creature cards and 4 land cards laid out in front of you, and an enchantment. Your opponent might have some creatures and a planeswalker on their side. All these cards are on the battlefield. If you cast a spell like \"Day of Judgment\" (destroy all creatures), it affects the battlefield by removing those creature permanents to the graveyard.",
      "suggestedEffect": "Visually, the battlefield is the main play area between players. Cards are laid out here with maybe a subtle battlefield background (like a stone arena or fantasy landscape). When creatures attack, they might lunge forward across the middle; blocking creatures move slightly to intercept. Area-of-effect spells animate across the battlefield (e.g., a wave for a board wipe). The battlefield zone itself could subtly highlight or pulse when new permanents enter (to draw the eye to their arrival) or when significant changes happen (like it clears after a board wipe, maybe a dust settling effect)."
    },
    {
      "name": "Graveyard",
      "description": "The graveyard is a player’s discard pile for cards that have been used or destroyed:contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}. It’s a public zone (both players can see its contents). Spells like instants and sorceries go to their caster’s graveyard after resolving. Creatures and other permanents go to their owner’s graveyard when destroyed, sacrificed, or discarded. Many cards interact with graveyards (for example, spells that revive creatures from the graveyard).",
      "example": "After you cast Lightning Bolt, it goes to your graveyard. If your creature dies in combat, it’s put into your graveyard. Each player has their own graveyard pile. A card like \"Snapcaster Mage\" can target an instant or sorcery card in your graveyard to allow you to cast it again (flashing it back). \"Scavenging Ooze\" can exile cards from graveyards to grow larger and gain you life. These examples show the graveyard being used as a resource even after cards go there.",
      "suggestedEffect": "Represented by a face-up pile or area next to the battlefield (often near its owner’s library). When a card goes to the graveyard, it flips face-up and slides onto the pile with a subtle rustle or thud. A creature dying might have its own death animation (like shattering or falling) and then the card goes to the graveyard pile with maybe a tombstone icon briefly rising. If a card is targeted in a graveyard, that card might glow or lift slightly from the pile to indicate interaction."
    },
    {
      "name": "Exile",
      "description": "Exile is a zone outside the typical game where cards are put when they are removed from play entirely:contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}. An exiled card is effectively “out of the game” except some effects can retrieve or interact with exiled cards. Exile is often the result of powerful removal (\"exile target creature\") or temporary banishing effects, and exiled cards do not go to graveyard when removed—they stay in exile until the game ends or an effect brings them back.",
      "example": "Swords to Plowshares – \"Exile target creature.\" That creature card is moved to its owner’s exile zone instead of their graveyard. It’s not coming back unless something specifically says it does. Another example: Oblivion Ring – when it enters, it exiles a target until Oblivion Ring leaves the battlefield (if Oblivion Ring is removed, the exiled card returns from exile to the battlefield). Exile is also used for cards with mechanics like Suspend (cards sit in exile with time counters) or cards that have been cast for their Adventure (from the Throne of Eldraine set) which go to exile before you can cast the creature part.",
      "suggestedEffect": "A bright flash or portal effect whisking the card off the battlefield entirely. The card might fly toward a designated “exile” area (often shown at the edge of the play area) with a sparkle or vanishing poof. Exiled cards could be shown as semi-transparent or with a unique border in that zone. An ethereal whoosh or chime emphasizes the card is gone beyond normal reach. If an exiled card is waiting (like suspended or set aside for a return), perhaps a visual counter or aura on it indicates its special status in exile."
    },
    {
      "name": "Stack",
      "description": "The stack is the zone where spells and abilities go when they are cast/activated and are waiting to resolve. It works in a last-in, first-out order:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}. Players can respond to a spell on the stack by adding another spell/ability on top of it. When a spell or ability on the stack resolves, it leaves the stack (going to its next destination, like the battlefield or graveyard). Only one thing resolves at a time, starting from the top of the stack.",
      "example": "You cast Giant Growth on your creature – it goes on the stack. Your opponent responds with Lightning Bolt targeting that creature – Bolt goes on top of the stack. Now Lightning Bolt (top) will resolve first, possibly killing the creature. Then Giant Growth tries to resolve on a creature that might no longer be there. This interplay demonstrates stack order. Another example: Counterspell targeting a spell – the counterspell sits on top of the spell it targets on the stack; if it resolves, it will remove that spell below from the stack (countering it) before it can resolve.",
      "suggestedEffect": "Graphically, spells on the stack might appear as small cards or icons in a column or pile on the side of the screen, with the topmost one highlighted. Each time someone adds a spell, you see a card image swoop onto the top of this stack. As they resolve, an animation for that spell’s effect plays and the card either moves to the appropriate zone (graveyard, etc.) or disappears. A stacking sound (like cards fanning or a magical woosh building up) could accompany multiple items on the stack. When the stack is empty (everything resolved), the column disappears, indicating no pending actions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Command Zone",
      "description": "The command zone is a special zone used for certain game components that are not in normal play. For example, in Commander format, each player’s commander card starts in the command zone (and can be cast from there, then returned there if it dies, with an additional cost). Emblems (permanent effects given by planeswalker abilities) reside in the command zone. Some casual variants (Planechase’s plane cards, Archenemy’s schemes) also use the command zone. It’s essentially an area for game pieces that aren’t in hand, library, battlefield, etc., but still affect the game.",
      "example": "Your Commander (say, \"Kaalia of the Vast\") begins in the command zone. You may cast Kaalia from there anytime you could cast a creature, paying its mana cost. If Kaalia dies, you have the option to put her back in the command zone instead of the graveyard (with a commander tax adding 2 extra mana next time you cast her). Another example: An emblem from Kaya the Inexorable that says “At the beginning of your upkeep, you may cast a legendary spell from your hand without paying its mana cost.” That emblem card is placed in the command zone as a reminder and its effect is active as long as it’s there. It can’t be removed by normal means since emblems are permanent and reside off the battlefield.",
      "suggestedEffect": "Represented by a separate area near each player’s avatar or life total. A commander card might appear there (perhaps slightly translucent or framed to show it’s not on the battlefield yet). Emblems might appear as icon cards or symbols in that area with their rule text accessible. Visually, summoning your commander from the command zone might have an extra flourish (because it’s your signature card) — e.g., a special border glow or sound (like a heroic fanfare) to signify the leader entering battle. Emblems could have a faint aura or sigil floating next to the player’s portrait to remind both players of the ongoing effect."

  ],
  "Flavor/Lore Cues": [
    {
      "cue": "Summons a god",
      "example": "Heliod, Sun-Crowned (a legendary enchantment creature — God). When a card depicts summoning a deity or a massive legendary creature, a divine presence is entering the battlefield.",
      "suggestedEffect": "A radiant divine glow descends from above along with a deep reverberating tone, perhaps accompanied by a brief choir chant or a thunderclap, signifying a god or mighty legendary being arriving."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Haunting whisper",
      "example": "A card like \"Haunting Hymn\" (flavor of ghostly voices causing discard) or a Spirit creature with flavor text about whispers. This implies ghostly voices or an eerie murmuring presence affecting the game.",
      "suggestedEffect": "Soft, echoing whispering audio and a translucent spectral silhouette drifting across the battlefield. Lights on the battlefield dim momentarily, and a chill wind sound underscores the spooky, unsettling atmosphere."
    },
    {
      "cue": "The ground shakes",
      "example": "Earthquake (a sorcery dealing damage to all creatures without flying) or the entrance of a colossal creature like \"Craterhoof Behemoth\". Flavor indicates a seismic disturbance.",
      "suggestedEffect": "A rumbling earthquake effect: the battlefield camera might shudder, dust clouds kick up, and a deep rumble is heard. Creatures might wobble or a spider-web of cracks appears on the ground for a moment."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Calls down lightning",
      "example": "Lightning Bolt (classic instant dealing lightning damage) or \"Storm’s Wrath\" (spell dealing damage from a storm). Suggests a bolt of lightning striking from the sky.",
      "suggestedEffect": "A dark cloud forms briefly above the target, then a brilliant lightning bolt crashes down with a crack of thunder, leaving a scorch mark or electrical sparks on the target area."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Breathes fire",
      "example": "Shivan Dragon’s activated ability (often nicknamed fire-breathing) or a spell like \"Dragon’s Breath\" aura. Indicates a dragon or creature exhaling flames.",
      "suggestedEffect": "The creature unleashes a cone of fire across the battlefield accompanied by a roaring sound. Flames billow and the target or area hit ignites briefly. If it’s an ability increasing power, the creature might surround itself with a fiery aura as it “heats up.”"
    },
    {
      "cue": "Raises the dead",
      "example": "\"Rise from the Grave\" (sorcery reanimating a creature from a graveyard) or Liliana’s ultimate ability summoning zombies. Implies necromancy bringing creatures back from death.",
      "suggestedEffect": "Hands or zombie silhouettes emerge from your graveyard pile or the ground, crawling onto the battlefield. A sickly green or purple necromantic glow accompanies the resurrected creatures. An eerie moan or a dark chant plays as the dead are summoned."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Divine light",
      "example": "\"Angelic Chorus\" (an enchantment that gains you life when creatures enter) or any effect described as a holy light or angelic intervention (often white magic).",
      "suggestedEffect": "A beam of bright golden-white light shines down on the affected area or creatures, coupled with a soft choir or heavenly chime. If creatures are buffed or healed, they might glow with a halo effect to show the blessing."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Curses a player",
      "example": "Curse cards like \"Curse of Misfortunes\" or \"Curse of Weakness\" (flavor: a hex placed on a player). Dark magic directed specifically at a player.",
      "suggestedEffect": "A swirling dark aura or a ghostly skull icon appears above the targeted player’s head/avatar. The sound of a witch’s cackle or a low sinister whisper can accompany it. The cursed player’s portrait might flicker with an overlay of cracked glass or shadow to indicate misfortune looming over them."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Time warp",
      "example": "\"Time Warp\" (take an extra turn) or \"Time Stop\" (end the turn immediately). Anything that manipulates turns or time flow in the game.",
      "suggestedEffect": "A ripple of distortion sweeps across the battlefield as if reality blurs. Clock gears or hourglass visuals might briefly overlay. For an extra turn, a whooshing wind-back sound or deep bell toll indicates a shift in time. If ending a turn, maybe everything briefly freezes with a record-scratch or snap sound, then resumes to the new state."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Mind control",
      "example": "\"Mind Control\" Aura (gain control of an enemy creature) or \"Coercion\" effects. Represents taking over an opponent’s creature or influencing their decisions with telepathy.",
      "suggestedEffect": "The targeted creature’s eyes or outline flash the color of the controller’s magic (blue glow for mind magic). A wavy psychic ring animation links from the caster to the creature. You hear a subtle hypnotic hum or a single deep *gong* to signify a mental takeover. The controlled creature then moves to the new controller’s side with a puppet-like motion."
    },
    {
      "cue": "An unbreakable barrier",
      "example": "\"Fog\" (prevent all combat damage) or \"Invincible Hymn\" (prevent damage for a time). Suggests a protective shield or wall of mist that nothing can penetrate in that moment.",
      "suggestedEffect": "A translucent dome or wall of light envelops the protected player’s side or the whole battlefield. Arrows or weapon blows are shown bouncing off or dissolving on contact. The audio might include a resonant hum or a chant, and enemy attack sounds are muffled to zero, emphasizing no damage gets through."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Summons a swarm",
      "example": "\"Empty the Warrens\" (creates multiple Goblin tokens) or \"Army of the Damned\" (many zombie tokens). Means suddenly a horde of creatures appear.",
      "suggestedEffect": "Rapid, repeated summoning animations - e.g., portals or magic circles flash in sequence, each releasing a creature. For a Goblin swarm, drumming war-cries and multiple little footsteps. For a zombie horde, hands bursting from the ground one after another. The battlefield fills with tokens accompanied by a crescendo of growls/chitters to indicate sheer quantity."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Life drain",
      "example": "\"Drain Life\" or \"Exsanguinate\" (spells that take life from opponents and give it to you). The flavor is siphoning life essence.",
      "suggestedEffect": "Dark tendrils or a vortex of purple/black energy flows from the opponent (or their creatures) to you. The opponent’s life total ticks down with each pulse of the effect, while yours ticks up correspondingly. Audio might feature a deep heartbeat slowing for the victim and a hollow sucking sound as life force is leached away, ending with a revitalizing sigh on your side."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Explosive blast",
      "example": "\"Fireball\" (big fire explosion damage) or \"Blasphemous Act\" (massive explosion harming all creatures). Essentially a big boom or fiery detonation in the flavor.",
      "suggestedEffect": "A fiery explosion graphic on the target area—flames erupt outward with debris flying. The screen might shake and a loud boom rattles the audio. For a one-target fireball, that target is engulfed in a fireball with trailing smoke. For a board-wide blast, a wave of fire sweeps across all creatures, possibly leaving charred visual effects in its wake."
    },
    {
      "cue": "Transmutation or polymorph",
      "example": "\"Polymorph\" (turns a creature into a different one) or \"Turn to Frog\" (target creature becomes a 1/1 Frog). This is the flavor of magically transforming a creature into something else, often something innocuous.",
      "suggestedEffect": "The target creature is enveloped in swirling magical energy. You might see sparkles or a cocoon of light, then *pop!* the creature’s model/art is replaced with the new form (like a frog token or a sheep, as in some fantasy tropes). A whimsical twinkle or croaking sound accompanies the transformation to highlight the (often comedic) drastic change."
